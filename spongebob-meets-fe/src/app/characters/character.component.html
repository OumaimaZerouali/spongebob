    <h2>SpongeBob Characters</h2>
    <p>
      The underwater world of Bikini Bottom is filled with quirky and memorable characters.
      SpongeBob SquarePants, an optimistic and enthusiastic sea sponge, lives in a pineapple under the sea and works at the Krusty Krab.
      His best friend, Patrick Star, is a lazy but lovable starfish who often joins SpongeBob on his adventures.
      Squidward Tentacles, their neighbor, is a cynical octopus who longs for a more refined life, often expressing his frustration with SpongeBob and Patrickâ€™s antics.
      Other notable characters include Mr. Krabs, the money-obsessed crab who owns the Krusty Krab, and Sandy Cheeks, a clever squirrel from Texas who loves karate and science.
      Together, these characters create a fun and chaotic atmosphere, making Bikini Bottom a place full of laughter and lessons.
